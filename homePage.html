                    The Apartheid Museum, the first of its kind, illustrates the rise
                    and fall of apartheid. An architectural consortium, comprising
                    several leading architectural firms, conceptualised the design of
                    the building on a seven-hectare stand. The museum is a super
                    community a unique South African experience.
