            I would really love to go to New York city, because its one of the

            treasures and more New York City attractions than you can count like
            the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, Grand Central
            Station and many more.

                    The Apartheid Museum, the first of its kind, illustrates the rise <br/>
                    and fall of apartheid. An architectural consortium, comprising <br/>
                    several leading architectural firms, conceptualised the design of <br/>
                    the building on a seven-hectare stand. The museum is a super <br/>
                    example of design, space and landscape offering the international <br/>
                    community a unique South African experience.
