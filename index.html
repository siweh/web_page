            the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, Grand Central
            Station and many more.

          <h2>The Apartheid Museum</h2>
          <p>
            The Apartheid Museum, the first of its kind, illustrates the rise
            and fall of apartheid. An architectural consortium, comprising
            several leading architectural firms, conceptualised the design of
            the building on a seven-hectare stand. The museum is a superb
            example of design, space and landscape offering the international
            community a unique South African experience.

            There is perhaps no other site of incarceration in South Africa that
            imprisoned the sheer number of world-renowned men and women as those
            held within the walls of Constitution Hill’s Old Fort, Women's Jail
            and Number Four. Nelson Mandela. Mahatma Gandhi. Joe Slovo.
            Albertina Sisulu. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Fatima Meer. They all
            served time here.
